# 🗑️ Files Safe to Delete

All these files were created during development/testing and are no longer needed now that your chatbot is working.

## ✅ Safe to Delete - Documentation Files

### Root Directory Documentation
```
❌ CONNECTION_CHECKLIST.md          - Backend connection guide (no longer needed)
❌ FIXING_CHATBOT_ERRORS.md         - Error fixing guide (resolved)
❌ FIX_LOGIN_404_ERROR.md           - Login error guide (resolved)
❌ QUICK_START.md                   - Quick start guide (testing only)
❌ FILES_TO_DELETE.md               - This file (delete after reviewing)
```

### Component Documentation
```
❌ asms_frontend/app/customer/components/CHATBOT_USAGE.md  - Usage guide (optional to keep)
```

## ✅ Safe to Delete - Example Java Files

These were example backend controllers I created for reference:

```
❌ AuthController.java              - Example auth controller (you have your own)
❌ ChatbotController.java           - Example chatbot controller (should be in your Spring Boot project)
❌ ChatController.java              - Duplicate/alternative example
```

**⚠️ Important:** If you haven't added the chatbot controller to your Spring Boot backend yet, copy `ChatbotController.java` to your backend project first, then delete it from here.

## ✅ Safe to Delete - Test Scripts

```
❌ test-connection.ps1              - PowerShell test script (if exists)
❌ test-backend.ps1                 - Backend test script (if exists)
```

   ```powershell
   git status
   git add .
   git commit -m "Cleanup: Remove testing and documentation files"
